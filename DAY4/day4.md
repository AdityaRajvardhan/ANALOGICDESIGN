# Day 4 – Analog Layout Design (Introduction & Hands-on)

The fundamentals of **Analog IC Layout Design** and the initial hands-on
experience using **Cadence Virtuoso Layout Editor**.

---

## Introduction to Layout Design

- Layout design is the physical realization of the schematic on silicon.
- Proper layout is critical for:
  - Performance
  - Matching
  - Noise reduction
  - Reliability
- Poor layout can degrade circuit behavior even if schematic is correct.

---

## Importance of Layout in Analog ICs

- Analog circuits are sensitive to:
  - Parasitics
  - Mismatch
  - Noise
- Layout directly impacts:
  - Gain
  - Offset
  - Bandwidth
  - Temperature stability
- Layout must follow strict design rules.

---

## Design Rules and Layout Constraints

- Design Rule Check (DRC) rules ensure manufacturability.
- Key rules discussed:
  - Minimum width and spacing
  - Enclosure rules
  - Via rules
- Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) ensures connectivity correctness.

---

## Analog Layout Techniques

- Matching techniques:
  - Common centroid layout
  - Interdigitated layout
- Guard rings used for noise isolation.
- Use of dummy devices to reduce edge effects.
- Symmetry maintained for matched devices.
- Routing considerations:
  - Short interconnects
  - Avoid sharp bends
  - Proper metal layer usage

---

## Introduction to Cadence Virtuoso Layout Tool

- Cadence Virtuoso Layout Editor introduced.
- Overview of:
  - Layout window
